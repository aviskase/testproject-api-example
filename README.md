# requests vs bravado for API testing

This is a small example of using ```requests``` or ```bravado``` libraries for API testing.
System under test is [TestProject](https://testproject.io/) API. You'll need an API key and existing project to be able to run tests.

To see in action:

1. Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
2. Edit ```conftest.py``` to use your API key and ```projectId```.
3. Run ```pytest```
